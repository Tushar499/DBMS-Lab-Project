Introduction: UIU Internal Job activities management system is a way to do all
activities via the website where Department can post recruitment for UA/Grader, Faculty
can ask UA/Grader from the department if needed and at the same time students can
apply for the job. There will have recommendation options where students are able to
ask for recommendations from faculty to be UA/Graders for a particular course. If they
get a recommendation then the department will consider that along with their CGPA and
they will be the first priority in the priority queue with other competitors who don’t have
any recommendations. Besides we’ve tried to include all necessary interactions with
Faculty and the student who is playing the role of a UA/Grader. For example, A
particular task will be provided by the faculty members and there will be a submission
portal. There will be a query section for students to clarify if he/she face any doubts
during evaluating the exam scripts or other kinds of stuff. Department and Faculty will
be able to post job circulars of a company and students will be able to see that post and
can apply to that particular position of company.
