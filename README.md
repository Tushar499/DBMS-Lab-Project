### Introduction
The UIU Internal Job Activities Management System is a web-based platform designed to streamline all internal job-related activities within the university. This system enables departments to post job openings for UA/Graders. Faculty members can request UA/Graders from the department as needed, and simultaneously, students can apply for these positions. The platform incorporates a recommendation system where students can seek endorsements from faculty members to become UA/Graders for specific courses. Endorsed students will receive priority consideration, along with their CGPA, in the selection process over other applicants without endorsements. Additionally, the system facilitates necessary interactions between faculty members and students working as UA/Graders. For instance, faculty members can assign tasks, provide submission portals, and offer a query section for students to seek clarification on evaluating exam scripts or other related tasks. Moreover, the platform allows departments and faculty members to post job circulars from external companies, giving students the opportunity to view and apply for these positions.
